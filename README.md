# GripScroll

Gripscroll is a Chrome extension that allows you to scroll while clicking in the left and right mouse buttons. It works kind of how the Apple touchpad works, the two finger scroll. I came up with this after I broke my mouse wheel and I was sick of using the arrow keys to scroll, thus this was born at 4am one weekend. Sad, I know.

It uses jQuery, but doesn't really need to, I'm just being lazy.
